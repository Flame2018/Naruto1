            <p>A lot has happened ever since becoming a genin. I was assigned team 7, with our leader being Kakashi Sensei. It may have started off really rough working with Sasuke and Sakura but we really grew into a great team. We had a run-in with this really formidable organization called the Akatsuki which Sasuke’s brother is apart of, and they’re hunting down all the Jinchuriki like myself to obtain the tailed-beasts sealed within us. That’s how I met Pervy Sage, my mentor who eventually takes me away from the village to train more extensively, I mean he is one of the Legendary Sanin. Anyways, before I left to train Sasuke was trying to leave to get stronger with that bastard Orochimaru, but I ended up being bested by Sasuke. Coming back to the village after a few years of my training with Pervy Sage lots of things changed especially since Sasuke had been gone ever since that day. To move forward, a war was close and in the making by Obito, Madara, and the Akatsuki. They needed all the tailed-beasts so they could resurrect the ten-tails who was far more powerful than any of the tailed beasts even combined. In the war, I got to meet my mother, fight alongside my father, and even be reunited with the real team 7 and all the tailed beasts. Finally, after the war and everything was done all Sasuke and I had to do was join hand signs together to free everyone, but Sasuke and I had differing opinions on how things should go from now on. So of course we fought and came to a consensus which ultimately resulted in peace for all.</p>
